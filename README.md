# Halwa

Halwa translates to "Sweet" from arabic.

Halwa Food is a food delivery mobile application currently only available on Android.

Though still in development, this app unique integrates with AlanAI voice to provide a voice user interface for users to be able to order food online using their voice, this is especially helpful for visually impaired users.

The Voice User Interface is based on the concept researched on by Medium user who posted their research as a blog. In case I find the link to her blog i will surely post it here :)
