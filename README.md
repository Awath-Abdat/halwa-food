# Halwa

Halwa, which translates to "Sweet😋" from arabic, is a project designed to provide users with a seamless and convenient food ordering experience through a Voice User Interface (VUI). The system is meant to allow users to interact with a virtual assistant using natural language commands, enabling them to place orders, receive personalized recommendations, and track deliveries solely through voice interactions.

The Voice User Interface is based on the concept suggested by Medium user *Vaidehi Vartak* who plotted out Zomatalk on her blog [here](https://medium.com/@vaidehivartak/zomatalk-vui-concept-for-ordering-food-online-a04f8e85c83e)
